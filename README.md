# IS THAT A KIRBY?!
Basically yes.

## How to install
Download the mod on releases pages and put it on `BepInEx/plugins` folder
You also need to download the dependencies [LethalLib](https://github.com/EvaisaDev/LethalLib) and [HookGenPatcher](https://github.com/harbingerofme/Bepinex.Monomod.HookGenPatcher), follow the instructions on their pages.

or

Just use a mod manager like thunderstore and add the [TheKirby](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/redystum/TheKirby/) mod

## What's this?
This is what happens when a Fullstack Developer tries to make a mod for a game without documentation... The result? Well...

## Things that are supposed to be working
- Kirby appears randomly (like other enemies) and tries to swallow you.

## Things that are (not) working
if you want to use these features you have to enable them on the config file (`BepInEx\config\Redystum.TheKirby.cfg` and set `Use item = true`)
- When you kill the Kirby, it drops a Kirby (very creative, I know)
- This Kirby can... Try to guess... It can swallow!!!
- Basically, it's a backpack and a jukebox

### Some important things
I just have the code here, if you want to make changes to unity stuff you have to create a new asset bundle

This project is based on [LC-ExampleEnemy](https://github.com/Hamunii/LC-ExampleEnemy) by [Hamunii](https://github.com/Hamunii)

The code is a mess and not commented, basically im learning while making this, im sorry for that

#### BUGS?
Just create an issue and some day I'll try to fix it
