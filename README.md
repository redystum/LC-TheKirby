# IS THAT A KIRBY?!
Basically yes.

## What's this?
This is what happens when a Fullstack Developer tries to make a mod for a game without documentation... The result? Very bad code that works... I think... I hope so...

## Things that are supposed to be working
- Kirby appears randomly (like other enemies) and tries to swallow you.
- When you kill the Kirby, it drops a Kirby (very creative, I know)
- This Kirby can... Try to guess... It can swallow!!!
- Basically, it's a backpack and a jukebox

#### BUGS?
Just create an issue and some day I'll try to fix it
