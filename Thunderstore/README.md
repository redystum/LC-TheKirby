# TheKirby

## Things that are supposed to be working
- Kirby appears randomly (like other enemies) and tries to swallow you.

### Things that are (not) working
if you want to use these features you have to enable them on the config file (`BepInEx\config\Redystum.TheKirby.cfg` and set `Use item = true`)
- When you kill the Kirby, it drops a Kirby (very creative, I know)
- This Kirby can... Try to guess... It can swallow!!!
- Basically, it's a backpack and a jukebox

#### Some important things
The kirby item is bugged and still in development, using it will cause loss or multiplication of items. Use at your own risk.

The mod have some bugs, some i know, some i dont, if you find one, please create an issue on [my GitHub](https://github.com/redystum/LC-TheKirby) and some day I'll try to fix it
